1. Install Virtualbox, Vagrant, git for windows

2. Add homestead box to vagrant stored boxes:
	vagrant box add laravel/homestead

3. Install homestead in ~\Homestead\

4. Edit ~\Homestead\Homestead.yaml:
	memory: 1024
	folders:
		- map: ~/PhpstormProjects/homesteadtest
		  to: /home/vagrant/code/homesteadtest

	sites:
		- map: homestead.test
		  to: /home/vagrant/code/homesteadtest/public

	databases:
		- homesteadtest

5. Create an empty php project in PHPStorm in ~\PhpstormProjects\homesteadtest\
and create new folder "public" inside. Create new index.php with "phpinfo()" in
"public" folder.

6. Vagrant up from ~/Homestead check in browser "homestead.test"
Search for "xdebug" in the web page output to confirm xdebug is already installed.
Also check which ini's are loaded for it.

7. vagrant ssh and sudo vim /etc/php/7.2/fpm/conf.d/20-xdebug.ini
(check the correct version and location instead of 7.2 as per phpinfo output)
By default it should contain:
	zend_extension=xdebug.so
	xdebug.remote_enable = 1
	xdebug.remote_connect_back = 1
	xdebug.remote_port = 9000
	xdebug.max_nesting_level = 512

Add (optionally, this will show "IDE key: PHPStorm" in phpinfo, else it would be
"IDE key: vagrant" -> should not matter):
	xdebug.idekey=PHPSTORM

Run:
sudo systemctl restart php7.2-fpm

7A. Optional to prevent output buffering and allow line-by-line output in browser.
Locate php.ini from phpinfo (here: sudo vim /etc/php/7.2/fpm/php.ini)
	implicit_flush and set it to "On"
	output_buffering and set it to 0 (from 4096)
Also make sure that this line is set like this:
	zlib.output_compression = Off
Also check the php file note on preventing output buffering.

8. Install XDebug Helper extension in Chrome and set its "idekey" to "PHPSTORM"

9. PHPStorm Settings -> PHP -> Servers -> Add new
Name: homestead-server
Host: homestead.test
Path mappings: check
The uppermost project folder (project root) -> /home/vagrant/code/homesteadtest
This should ensure there are no popups to create new server (and mappings) when
debugging starts.

9A. Since homestead uses nginx, these are also necessary to stop output
buffering (and being able to see echo output printed in browser line-by-line
"in real time").
In /etc/nginx/nginx.conf these must be set (inside "http {...}" worked, gzip setting was already there):
	gzip off;
	fastcgi_buffering off;
	fastcgi_keep_conn on; # < solution
	proxy_buffering off;
Check out the disable-output-buffering.php

10. Change index.php in "public" folder of the project:
	<?php
	for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++){
		echo $i . "<br>";
	}
and place a breakpoint on the echo line.

11. Run -> Start Listening to PHP Debug connections.

12. Go to homestead.test in browser. Click the XDebug helper's button and enable
debugging.

13. PHPStorm debugger interface should be triggered. Press F8 to step over the
lines and watch the echo in the browser appear one-by-one, while stepping over
the loop (if step 7A was followed).
