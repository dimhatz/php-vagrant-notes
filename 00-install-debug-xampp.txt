A. On XAMPP Windows
(as per instructions here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL60RCKv7lQ)

1. Install XAMPP and install XDebug using special site
https://xdebug.org/wizard.php
and pasting the output of phpinfo() there.

2. Download the binary from step 1 and place it in the appropriate dir.

3. Select php.ini from XAMPP manager program to edit it with notepad.

4. Add the following:
	(from the xdebug wizard)
	zend_extension = C:\xampp\php\ext\php_xdebug-2.6.1-7.2-vc15.dll
	(and from the guy on the vid)
	xdebug.default_enable=1
	xdebug.remote_enable=1
	xdebug.idekey=PHPSTORM
and check phpinfo() again to CTRL-F for "xdebug" to make sure it installed correctly.

5. In php.ini to stop output buffering and see echo printed immediately:
CTRL-F for:
	implicit_flush and set it to "On"
	output_buffering and set it to 0 (from 4096)
Also make sure that this line is set like this:
	zlib.output_compression = Off
Restart apache when done.
Also check the php file note on preventing output buffering.

6. Install XDebug helper extension and set its key to PHPSTORM

7. Create new project inside XAMPP's htdocs, ex. xampp\htdocs\xampptest.

8. Add to PHPStorm new local interpreter from xampp\php\

9. Edit xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf and add:
# this entry will list all the hosted subfolders (just for convenience)
<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"
	ServerName myapache.test
	<Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs">
		Allow from all
		Require all granted
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

# this will provide mappings to the project itself
<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/xampptest"
	ServerName xampp.test
</VirtualHost>

10. Edit C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts and add
	127.0.0.1 myapache.test xampp.test
The result from step 9 and 10 is that local apache directory listing is now at
myapache.test (for convenience) and the site will be at xampp.test.

11A. Debugging using browser plugin (see step 6)
Settings -> PHP -> Servers -> Add new
Name "Apache on XAMPP"
Host "xampp.test"
Create index.php in the project:
	<?php
	for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++){
		echo $i . "<br>";
	}
Put a breakpoint on the echo line and press "Start Listening to PHP Debug connections" button.
Refresh the page in the browser.
Press F8 to step over each line check how the echoes are presented one-by-one in browser.

11B. Debugging with Webstorm's application settings (Not as good as step 11A).
From PHPStorm menu Run -> Edit Configurations -> click "+" and select PHP Web Page
and name this "Debug with application settings".
Add new server -> name it "Apache on XAMPP" and put url "xampp.test"
Add "Start URL" -> /xampptest
Create index.php in the project:
	<?php
	for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++){
		echo $i . "<br>";
	}
Put a breakpoint on the echo line and press debug button (or Run -> Debug "Debug with application settings").
Press F8 to step over each line check how the echoes are presented one-by-one in browser.

12. Note: in the debugging console, when the "Use console input" button is on,
you can type php commands that will be hot-run during the breakpoint, ex. you
can hot-change a variable like "$i = -11;"
When it is off, then whatever you type is the STDIN input that will be passed
to the program (if it is a command-line script).

13. To be able to run php pages using the "browser icons" that pop-up in upper
right corner of the editor, go Tools -> Deployment -> Configuration and add new:
Name: "XAMPP in place", Type: In place
Web server root URL: xampp.test
Now when clicking on the icons the correct page opens.
